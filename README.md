# NoteTaker
Let's Take some notes!

## Description 

This project is focused around building a server and using a json file as a sort of database. This was built using some base starter code for the front end developed by the bootcamp, and it was simply required for us to build the backend server, database, and api calls. This project was then deployed to Heroku to keep it available for testing to the masses. 


## Installation

You can download this repo at https://github.com/DaronSchmit/NoteTaker then run `npm install` to download dependencies. Then find the server file by going into Develop/Server folders and running either `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js` depending on what you have installed. The server defaults to port 8080, so go to 'localhost:8080' to see it deployed.

Additionally, you can skip the downloading and go straight to https://hidden-ocean-39633.herokuapp.com/ to see the project deployed live.


## Usage 

![NoteTaker Demo!](./readmeAssets/NoteTaker.gif)

Load the webpage using one of the methods mentioned above, then press the Get Started button in the center of the page. This will bring you to the note taking and display page. You can click into each text field to edit it, then save using the icon in the top right. NOTE: You can only save the note if there is text in both the title and text fields. You can then display previously saved notes by clicking on them and delete them by clicking the red trash can. If you would like to take a new note after viewing others, press the pencil icon in the top left.

## Credits

credit to the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp for the starting files. The source is in a private gitlab, so I cannot share it. 
special thanks to Charlie, the instructor, as well as Jake, Paul, and the other TAs for answering so many questions. Thank you to materialize for the css framework, I hope I learn to use it better in the future.
